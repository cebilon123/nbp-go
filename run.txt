In this task, there weren't any information about using flags or ENV variables, so all variables are hard coded
into the code.

one log line contains all information about isJson etc. and contains the dates from the additional task.

How to run?

    Install GO in the version 1.18 (go.mod)
    Put the repo into valid directory or change GO ENV VARIABLES accordingly.
    Run go run main.go in the root directory of repo.

Second running path (for those, that are not having GO installed), in bin directory, there is an .exe to run the
app.

    On windows:

        Just run it. (winbuild)

        log.txt will be in the same directory

    On MAC: (macbuild)

        open bin directory in terminal and run:

        chmod +x ./macbuild (to ensure this is an executable)

        and then in directory open it in the terminal.

        the log.txt should be then in yours user directory.  (i.e. if your acc name is: jhon it will be jhon/log.txt)
